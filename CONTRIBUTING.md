# Contributing to the radiative forcing tutorial

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.
All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reflective-org/carma-jax.git
cd carma-jax
```

2. Install
Follow the installation instructions in [the README](./README.md#installation).

## Development Workflow

1. Create a branch for your work using one of these prefixes:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name       # new feature
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix             # bug fix
git checkout -b docs/what-you-documented     # documentation only
git checkout -b test/what-you-tested         # adding/improving tests
git checkout -b refactor/what-you-refactored # restructure without behavior change
git checkout -b perf/what-you-optimized      # performance improvement
```

2. Make your changes and ensure they pass all tests.

3. Commit your changes with a clear message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add brief description of change"
```

4. Push and open a pull request against the `dev` branch.

## Code Style
- PEP 8 with 4-space indentation
- Type hints encouraged for public APIs
- No enforced formatter yet; please match the surrounding style

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/unit/ -v                  # Run the Unit Test Suite
python scripts/validate_coagtest.py    # Fortran benchmark comparison
python scripts/fortran_vs_jax_47bin.py # 1000-scenario validation
```

### Writing Tests

- Tests should live in `tests/` and use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).
- Shared fixtures and mocks should live in `tests/conftest.py`.
- Mock any cloud or network calls; tests must run offline.
- Aim for one test file per source module (e.g. `test_storage.py` for `storage.py`).

## Reporting Issues

When reporting a bug, please include:

- Python version
- Package version
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Full error traceback
